//stuff i know and i want to have improved in my lifetime

memo scrolldown on focus same like for unfocused
ICRmemo = memo behavior!
ARSSE Finder improvement (reverse search + shortkeys)
colored backgrounds playerlist
treeviewlike cmdbox (collors , +/- for titles)
posfix irccmd etc
memo ctrl+click text selection of executed text
better adminbubi
ctrl+a 2x in cmd line when admin or normal chat mode is on = wholetextselected
disconnect access voilation on debug for IRC
SolTV
Updater (with window where you can choose what you want to download and with download statusbar/progressbar)
ip.abd full load (no file access all the time)
profiler test (finding out where ARSSE uses most of his time so that it can be made fasteahr)
Mulitthreading (at least for the connecting stuff since ARSSE freezes when you connect to a down server)
Scriping values for all events (see manits)
scripting variables (wow bin event :P)
plugins
...


//done
after closing configuration window at IRC tab it says "cannot focus a disabled or invisible window
hacker alert removal
' ' adds ' <nick>'
save typed text before up down arrow are pressed so that it can be reached
nearly all inputs dont support ctrl+a (SoldatServerConsole and SettingsForm supports)
uneccesary flags remove (removed non-used flags from folder. still left 10 missing files according to FlagDB.pas)
Focus fix (isn't it?)
